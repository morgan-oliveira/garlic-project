This is garlic, a tkinter-based software which marks the beginning of my 'self-taught developer as quickly as possible' career change plan.
Garlic is designed to be a registration software for hospitals and clinics, which are quite common here in my city (Natal, RN, Brazil).
I chose the name "garlic" because I think it is the best thing in the world.

Wish me luck!
